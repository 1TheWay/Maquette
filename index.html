            <br><br>
            What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.
            <br><br>
            But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:
            An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.
            <br><br>
            Put even simpler — <strong>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</strong></p>
